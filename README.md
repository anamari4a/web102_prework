## Notes 
- Using JavaScript array methods like `reduce` and `filter` was challenging, especially when extracting and summing specific properties from an array of objects. 
- Practicing the spread operator and destructuring was a bit challenging when selecting and displaying the top two games. Sorting the array and using these features to efficiently extract and present the correct game information required practice.
